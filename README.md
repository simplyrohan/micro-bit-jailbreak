# micro-bit-jailbreak
An attempt to create a custom firmware for the BBC micro:bit so full functionality of the processor can be used.

# building
The current micro:bit firmware uses a `yotta` build system ([install](https://docs.yottabuild.org/#installing-on-linux)).
However, the project is deprecated and unmaintained. Unsurprisingly so, I could not install it locally due to many conflicting packages. I did manage to install it on an Ubuntu virtual machine (Github Codespace)
