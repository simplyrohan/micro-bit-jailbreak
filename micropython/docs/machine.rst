Machine
*******

.. py:module:: machine

The machine module contains specific functions related to the micro:bit 
hardware. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct and 
unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system (like CPU, 
timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to malfunction, lockups, 
crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware damage.


Functions
=========

.. method:: machine.unique_id()

    Returns a byte string with a unique identifier of a board. It will vary 
    from one board instance to another.


.. method:: machine.reset()

    Resets the device in a manner similar to pushing the external RESET button.


.. method:: machine.freq()

    Returns CPU frequency in hertz.


.. method:: machine.disable_irq()

    Disable interrupt requests. Returns the previous IRQ state which should be 
    considered an opaque value. This return value should be passed to the 
    :func:`machine.enable_irq()` function to restore interrupts to their 
    original state, before :func:`machine.disable_irq()` was called.


.. method:: machine.enable_irq(state)

    Re-enable interrupt requests. The *state* parameter should be the value 
    that was returned from the most recent call to the
    :func:`machine.disable_irq()` function.


.. method:: machine.time_pulse_us(pin, pulse_level, timeout_us=1000000)

    Time a pulse on the given *pin*, and return the duration of the pulse in 
    microseconds. The *pulse_level* argument should be 0 to time a low pulse or
    1 to time a high pulse.

    If the current input value of the pin is different to *pulse_level*, the 
    function first (*) waits until the pin input becomes equal to 
    *pulse_level*, then (**) times the duration that the pin is equal to 
    *pulse_level*. If the pin is already equal to *pulse_level* then timing 
    starts straight away.

    The function will return -2 if there was timeout waiting for condition 
    marked (*) above, and -1 if there was timeout during the main measurement, 
    marked (**) above. The timeout is the same for both cases and given by 
    *timeout_us* (which is in microseconds).


Reading Memory
==============

The ``machine`` module allows you to read from the device's memory, getting 1 
byte (8 bits; ``mem8``), 2 byte (16 bits; ``mem16``), or 4 byte (32 bits; 
``mem32``) words from physical addresses. For example: ``mem8[0x00]`` reads 1 
byte on physical address ``0x00``. This has a number of uses, for example if 
you'd like to read data from the nRF51 registers.
